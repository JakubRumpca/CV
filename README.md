# CV

This repository contains the HTML file of my CV, which is styled with a separate CSS file. This makes it easier to manage styles and the code remains clear and readable.

## Repository content

- **index.html** - HTML file containing the CV content. By clicking the download button, you can also download your CV in PDF format.
- **style.css** - A separate CSS file containing all the styles used on the page.

## Key features

- The HTML file only contains the structure and content of the CV, while the CSS file contains all the styles. This makes the code more organized and easier to manage.
- Styles are designed to make the website responsive and look good on a variety of devices, including computers, tablets and smartphones.
- The project was deployed using Netlify thanks to which the document is available at the link https://jakub-rumpca-cv.netlify.app/.
- The website has been validated using the W3C Validator (https://validator.w3.org/) to ensure it complies with the latest HTML and CSS standards.
